# Microsearch

- `microsearch` is a minimalistic Elixir search engine.
- It's based on [microsearch](https://github.com/alexmolas/microsearch).
- You can visit [https://microsearch.fly.dev/](https://microsearch.fly.dev/) to see it in action. However, it may take some time if the server is down and running again.
